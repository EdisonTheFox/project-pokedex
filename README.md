# Project Pokedex

A better Pokedex for iOS and Android.

## Why make another Pokedex app?

For the longest time I have been searching for a good and functional Pokedex app for iOS. And this is going to be it. Written in React Native, this app aims to be the best cross platform Pokedex application on all smartphones.

## Planned features

- Comprehensive break down of each Pokemon
- Comprehensive list of all moves in the games
- Comprehensive list of all abilities in the games
- Filters!
- Living Dex tracker (Both normal and shiny variants)
- Team Builder with type coverage calculations

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React Native
- Database utilising native SQLite
- Data Sourced from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) using the [pokenode-ts](https://pokenode-ts.vercel.app/) wrapper
